This is the module file for the common code in the sender, channel and reciever programs.

Currently, this can be run to spawn two threads, a receiver and a sender.
Run like the folowing:

    >>> python 264.py 4000 4001

where '4000' is the port to send to
and   '4001' is the port to receive from.
